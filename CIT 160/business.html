        <h1>DeWitt's Truck and Auto Repair</h1>
        <p> Have you ever felt like your mechanic has taken advantage of you?

        <p>DeWittâ€™s Truck and Auto Repair has been serving customers in the
            Show Low and Linden area for more than 20 years. We understand the
            importance of providing honest, friendly, and professional
            automotive repair service as the vast majority of our new customers
            are referred to us by those we currently serve. Our goal is to build
            lifelong relationships with our customers and provide them with the
            best and most reliable car repair service available in the
            automotive industry. We are able to do this by using
            state-of-the-art and up-to-date equipment and employing well trained
            and highly skilled ASE certified mechanics with experience servicing
            American and Asian cars and light trucks. In view of the fact that
            an automobile is the second most expensive investment most Americans
            make aside from their homes, we have developed our Certified
            Maintenance Program. The purpose of this program is to help you to
            properly maintain your vehicle allowing you to reduce your overall
            operating cost by one-half over the next five years.</p>
